            Why It Matters
          </h2>
          <p>
            Food waste is a major global crisis - while millions suffer from
            hunger daily, nearly one-third of all food produced is discarded,
            wasting vital resources like water, energy, and labor, and
            contributing significantly to climate change. At Feeding Futures, we
            tackle this issue head-on by rescuing surplus food and efficiently
            redirecting it to those in need through real-time tracking and smart
            logistics.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our mission goes beyond feeding the hungry, it is about building a
            sustainable community that values every meal, protects our planet,
            and creates lasting impact. By turning food waste into nourishment,
            we are shaping a healthier, more equitable future for all.
          </p>

            Making a Difference
          </h2>
          <p>
            Making a difference every day, we rescue surplus food - from small
            donations to large festival feasts - and transform it into
            thousands of nutritious meals for communities in need. Through
            strong partnerships with local NGOs and dedicated volunteers, we
            ensure every meal reaches those who need it most quickly and
            efficiently, creating a lasting positive impact across many lives
            each week.

            We invite you to be part of this journey - whether you are a donor
            with surplus food, a volunteer with a heart to help, or a partner
            organization committed to change. Because every bite shared today
            shapes the future we feed.
